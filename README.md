```
const clacAge3 = birthYear => 2073 - birthYear;
const age = clacAge3(2007);
console.log(age);


const mobileNameAndWarranty = (buyYear, timeUsed, naam) => {
    const warrantyTime = 2025 - buyYear;
    const warrantyLeft = warrantyTime - timeUsed;
    return `${naam} warranty left only ${warrantyLeft}`;
}
const hi3 = mobileNameAndWarranty(2023, 1, "poco");
console.log(hi3)
```
**look here i write many parameters and also many lines of code here**


### Class6 - of - chapter2 - Functions Calling Other Functions
![📄 View image](./images/class6-chapter2_1.jpg) 
- or another example is 
```
var warrantyMonths = function (inMonths) {
    return inMonths * 12;
}

const mobileNameAndWarranty2 = (buyYear1, timeUsedInYears1, naam1) => {
    const warrantyTime1 = 2025 - buyYear1;
    const warrantyLeft1 = warrantyTime1 - timeUsedInYears1;

    var howMonths = warrantyMonths(warrantyLeft1)


    return `${naam1} warranty left only ${howMonths} months`;
}
const hi32 = mobileNameAndWarranty2(2023, 1.5, "poco m4 pro 5G");
console.log(hi32)
```
## look how calling function from another function works
